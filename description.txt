Borderlands Mod!

I feel like there's quite a bit of room left for more guns, MORE guns, and MOOOORRRE GUUUUNNNNS.

So I am adding more.

## Weapons

1. Infection
Low-ish damage, on crit will infect enemy for 12 seconds with high DOT. Enemy can infect other nearby enemies. After infection enemy gains immunity for 12 seconds.

2. Infinity
Does not use ammo; shoots in a sine wave pattern.

3. Longbow
Uses bullets to shoot arrows. Always ignites; chance to cause additional burn DOT.

4. Maggie
Pistol shotgun with very tight spread.

5. Stalker
Slow moving bullets with high damage and auto-aims at closest enemy in-sight on bounce.

6. Unkempt Harold
Shoots explosive shots that splits in a 3-5-7 pattern.
